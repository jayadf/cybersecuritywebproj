                <h2>Arms Trafficking:</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
            Arms trafficking or gunrunning is the illicit trade of contraband small arms and ammunition, which constitutes part of a broad range of illegal activities often associated with transnational criminal organisations. The illegal trade of small arms, unlike other organised crime commodities, is more closely associated with exercising power in communities instead of achieving economic gain.
            <br>
            <br>
            To keep track of imports and exports of several of the most dangerous armament categories, the United Nations, in 1991, created a Register for Conventional Arms, however participation is not compulsory and lacks comprehensive data in regions outside of Europe. Africa, due to a prevalence of corrupt officials and loosely enforced trade regulations, is a region with extensive illicit arms activity. In a resolution to complement the Register with legally binding obligations, a Firearms Protocol was incorporated into the UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime, which requires states to improve systems that control trafficked ammunition and firearms.</p>

            The 1999 Report of the UN Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms provides a more refined and precise definition, which has become internationally accepted. This distinguishes between small arms (revolvers and self-loading pistols, rifles and carbines, submachine guns, assault rifles, and light machine guns), which are weapons designed for personal use, and light weapons (heavy machine guns, hand-held under-barrel and mounted grenade launchers, portable anti-aircraft guns, portable anti-tank guns, recoilless rifles, portable launchers of anti-aircraft missile systems, and mortars of calibres less than 100 mm), which are designed for use by several persons serving as a unit. Ammunition and explosives also form an integral part of small arms and light weapons used in conflict.

            The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 has a target to significantly reduce illicit financial and arms flows by 2030 as part of measures aimed at combating all forms of organized crime including arms trafficking.

            With this information: our undocumented firearms dealership service is where one party communicates and purchases firearms with non-visable traceable serial numbers from another party. It involves an illegal agreement that remains hidden between two or more parties, depending on the products, price and quantity. Although these are generally known as firearms dealers - they may stock more than firearms, such as blades, blunt objects, explosives etc. Once the deal is complete, the payment method would be focused around crypto currency, which is also untraceable for both parties.
