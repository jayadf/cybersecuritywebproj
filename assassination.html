                <h2>Contract Killer:</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Our contract killing service is a form of murder in which one party hires another party to kill a targeted person or multiple people. It involves an illegal agreement that remains undocumented between two or more parties, in which one party agrees to kill the target in exchange for some form of payment, monetary or otherwise. However, our service involves payment via crypto currency.

                Either party may be a person, group, or organisation. Contract killing has been associated with organised crime, government conspiracies, and vendettas. For example, in the United States, the gang Murder, Inc. committed hundreds of murders on behalf of the National Crime Syndicate during the 1930s and 1940s.

                Contract killing provides the hiring party with the advantage of not having to carry out the actual killing, making it more difficult for law enforcement to connect them with the murder. The likelihood that authorities will establish that party's guilt for the committed crime, especially due to lack of forensic evidence linked to the contracting party, makes the case more difficult to attribute to the hiring party.

                Contract killers may exhibit serial killer traits, but are generally not classified as such because of third-party killing objectives and detached financial and emotional incentives. Nevertheless, there are occasionally individuals that are labeled as both hitmen and serial killers. A contract killer is colloquially known as a hitman.

                Contract killers who work for criminal organisations and are assigned to murder a targeted person are often known as enforcers.</p>
